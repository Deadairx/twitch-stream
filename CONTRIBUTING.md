This is an Open Source stream.

You are more than welcome here to make addtions and changes to any notes
and submit a PR for them. I __will__ consider them, and maybe even go over 
them on stream.

If you'd like to correct spelling mistakes, that's alright by me, I'm terrible
at spelling and don't use a spellchecker in vim.

I have some [Issues](https://github.com/Deadairx/twitch-stream/issues) up for
changes or additions I'd like to make. If you have thoughts on the matter and 
would like to share your knowledge, please make PR and tag the issue.
