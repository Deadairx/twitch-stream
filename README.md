This is an experiment with an open source stream

I stream on twitch at https://www.twitch.tv/deadairx

The idea is to use this repo as a way of keeping organized with the stream

Maybe I'll use it to host show note, or maybe I'll make sub repos for projects
or maybe not. I don't really want to touch Sub-modules again...
