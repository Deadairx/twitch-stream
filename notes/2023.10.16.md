I want to have a better way of doing a live Zettlekasten
    - want to do it the way rwxrob does it
    - `zettle` loads up vim where he types his thoughts, `:wq` and it commits it


- [âœ…] I want to change my camera settings in OBS
[live editing your stream](live-editing-your-stream.md)

I am not feeling terribly great today
