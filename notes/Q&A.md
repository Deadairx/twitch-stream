## What do you think about Copilot?
I think it's good on a small scale

I have it running in Neovim and my main gripe is that it will be wrong most of the time when it tries to predict more than 2 lines. I wish that it would let me only accept one line at a time or better yet, only suggest one line at a time. (if you know how to do this, please let me know)

It's really good at most tried and true problems, I once code a mandalbrot set from a book and Copilot was able to predict a majority of the code.

Tedious Patterns are way easier to implement. I love building a Builder Pattern, but it's tedious. With Copilot, all I need to have is a struct and then write `MyStructBuilder` and Copilot will fill in everything you need. (Although I usually delete the ones I don't need in the moment because YAGNI)
