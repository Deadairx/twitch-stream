# Bevy
## What is Bevy?
Bevy is a game engine written in Rust.

https://bevyengine.org/

## Why Bevy?
Mainly wanted to program in Rust. Bevy was recommened by the now unmaintained 
Amethyst engine as the best Rust Game engine availiable.

## What does the future hold for learning?
- Mod other games written with Bevy to get more practial experiance
    - this [Tetris clone](https://github.com/corbamico/bevy-tetris) does 
    not have a soft drop mechanic, may want to try implementing it
- May want to create a game from scratch
    - Tetris clone
    - Pizza Chef

I don't plan on making a career out of this or anything, it's just a muse for
my side projects.
