# Dvorak

I've been using Dvorak as my primary keyboard layout since 2013

## Questions I get

### How long does it take to learn?
At least 6 months, and your Qwerty speed WILL suffer. If you want to keep your ability
to type Qwerty, you will need to practice both layouts in parrallel, making learing 
take a bit longer.

### Do you use Dvorak on your phone too?
No, I think Dvorak's strengths are in touch typing, and I have to look at the 
keyboard anyway on my phone, so I just opt for Qwerty. Also I believe auto correct
are better optimized for Qwerty layout.

### What do you think of Colmack?
I'm sure it's fine, I barely looked into it. I like Dvorak's choice of 
prioritizing vowels on one side and common constantants on the other, so I 
don't think I would switch if I could magically learn Colmack.

## Pros and Cons

✅ learned how to touch type
✅ hardly any wrist strain from long periods of typing
❌ Gaming is a pain on Dvorak, most games require a lot of remapping
❌ Takes months to learn
❌ Qwerty speed is heavily affected while learning
