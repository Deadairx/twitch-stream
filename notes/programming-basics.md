# How to get started with programming

## Choosing a Languge

It does not matter what languge you start with, pick one you like and dive 
deep into it. Once you have a firm grasp on one languge, learning other languges
gets easier.

That said, I do have some thoughts on which languges I might recommend 
depending on your goals.


### If you want maximum versatility and support
JavaScript, it's the most popular languge so googling for help will be easier 
and you can get a job doing just about anything with JavaScript. It also can be 
forgiving with its syntax (that can be a bad thing too)

I strongly believe learning strongly typed languge is better long term, so I 
be best to learn 

However, JS can be less performant at scale and lacks 


### If you want to get into the nitty gritty
Rust, 
C

ðŸ¤” Is it a good idea to start someone out on a more complex languge like Rust?
Maybe you start with Rust, only do a few projects to get the fundamentals of
programming and then once the basics of types are engrained, set them loose
on something like TypeScript.

### You want to only understand how computers work in general
Probably C# or Java. It also depends on what context you want to learn.

### You want to do moding for games
Lua, or whichever scripting languge your game supports. (ex. Skyrim has their own
scripting languge called TESScript)
