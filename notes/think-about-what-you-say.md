# Think about what you say

Try to avoid using curse words and/or filler words (uh, um, or like (with no context))

filler words are a natural reaction to hold attention while you're speaking
to keep the other party from interrupting. 

filler words can be very distracting.

This spawns an idea to create a virtual swear jar that keeps count over the 
stream, and the goal is to keep the count per hour low.

I feel like, in a way, swear words are fillers words.
